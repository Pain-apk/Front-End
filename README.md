# Front-End
This is my repository, where I will be learning complete front-end development, from revising fundamentals to advanced javascript.
<p>
Java-Script is a programming language made for web, and it can within browser.
There are lot' of frameworks in Javascript for front-end, back-end, mobile-development, machine learning using tesorflow.
Framework is something that are built around a programming language that allows developer to do something more smoothly. 
React was made by Facebook developers to make things easy and clearer.
